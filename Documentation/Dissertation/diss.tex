\chapter{Introduction}
    In this chapter we introduce the problem: what data we are given and what would we like to do with it? We will 
    suggest some possible methods that could be used to implement a solution. We describe how we might want to 
    evaluate the performance of the system. Finally we will outline the overall pipeline of the system.

    \section{What are we trying to do?}
        *TODO* \\

        We can briefly describe the system as taking an image with a spectrum of intensity values at each pixel and we wish to 
        produce a pixel labelling. A pixel labelling is... and is often referred to as an image segmentation.

\chapter{Preparation}
    In this section we investigate multiple machine learning algorithms, and decide on which may be reasonable to use
    in this project. We then investigate noise models for images, how they can be applied to our `hyperspectral' case 
    and what can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the noise.

\chapter{Implementation}
    In this chapter we elaborate on the implementations of the randomised forests and neural network solutions. 
    Similarly we discuss the de-noising aspect of the system. We then look at how each of the random forests and neural 
    networks were trained for the example data sets provided. We finally return to look at the overview of the system 
    and how all of the components fit together into a pipeline.

\cleardoublepage
\chapter{Evaluation}
    In this section we will evaluate the performance of the implemented machine learning solutions, comparing them based 
    on the following metrics: accuracy of pixel labellings from a test set with known classifications prior, training 
    time (as a function of the size of the training sequence) and classification time (as a function of the size of the 
    image). I will also look at how each of the components of the system effects each of the metrics mentioned in 
    isolation.
